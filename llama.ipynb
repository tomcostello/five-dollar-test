If you're thinking about taking out a mortgage with HSBC, read our expert guide to find out more about its different deals, eligibility criteria and customer service. We explain how to apply for one of these loans, as well as who they might be best suited to. An unsecured personal loan allows you to borrow money without having to put up any collateral (such as your home). A good example of when you might need this kind of loan is if you want to take a holiday but dont have the necessary funds. You can then pay back the loan over a set period - usually several years. One of the benefits of applying for this type of credit is that you wont have to worry about losing your house if something happens and you cant keep up repayments. However, lenders are likely to check your credit history before approving your application, so make sure youve paid all your bills on time beforehand. Before you start the application process, think carefully about whether you can afford to meet the month-to-month payments comfortably. Your first point of contact will probably be via the phone.\n",

      "Today we look at how to use the minimax algorithm to create an unbeatable AI for Tic-Tac-Toe that will never lose a game. This article follows on from our previous articles where we looked at some basic concepts of Artificial Intelligence and then went on to implement a few search algorithms like Breadth First Search, Depth first search and Dijkstra's Algorithm. Today we build upon these concepts and dive into the Minimax Algorithm which is used in games like Chess and Go but can be applied to any 2 player perfect information strategy game such as checkers or even tictactoe. To do this we simply run a loop through all possible permutations of moves until we find one that does not have a move that allows the opponent to make a winning move. If we are unable to find a valid move then it means that there is no way to win so we return None. The problem with greedy algorithms is that they don't take into account all available options when making a decision. In other words, they give us a suboptimal result because they only consider the next best step instead of the optimal sequence of steps required to solve the problem completely. For example, if we wanted to get water from a river across a field to a house we could either carry the water in buckets or construct a canal. Carrying water would require a lot of trips back and forth between the river and the house whereas digging a small canal would allow us to transport large amounts of water quickly and efficiently. As you can see, both methods work, but one method is far more efficient than the other.\n"

      "If you've ever taken a stroll through your local grocery store or farmers market, you may have noticed some confusion surrounding these two similar-looking vegetables. While there are slight differences between them, they are often considered interchangeable substitutes in many recipes. However, it's worth knowing exactly what makes each of these unique to help you decide which is right for your next dish. Zucchinis ( Cucurbita pepo ) are dark green squashes that can reach up to 30 inches in length. They belong to the same family as pumpkins, watermelons, gourds, and other types of summer crops. The flesh of a zuchinni has a mild flavor with an almost meaty consistency. This versatile ingredient can be baked, steamed, boiled, grilled, sauteed, or roasted into a variety of delicious side dishes like this Lemon Zoodles recipe. Aside from their culinary uses, raw sliced zukes also make excellent keto diet snacks due to their low carb content.

Instead, the plant most commonly referred to as a \"regular\" cuckumber falls under the botanical name of \"Luffa acutangula.\" It grows on vines much like its kin, but instead of having a juicy interior, its pulp is quite dry and fibrous. In fact, when fully ripe, luffas are usually harvested for their spongy se\n"

      "Kidney stones are hard masses of salts and minerals that form in the kidneys when there is a decrease in urine volume and/or an excess of stone-forming substances. There are different types of kidnesy stones. The most common type is made of calcium oxalate. Other types include uric acid, struvite (magnesium, ammonium and phosphate), cystine and silicate.\n",
      "*: Severe back, side (flank) or abdominal pain; pain radiating to the groin and genitals may also occur.  Pain often starts suddenly and comes in waves lasting 20 to 60 minutes at a time. Sometime pain subsides on its own only to recur days later. Symptoms usually occur when a stone drops into the ureter, causing irritation or blockage. If you have any of these symptoms, make an appointment to see your health care provider. Your provider will review your medical history and ask you about your diet, lifestyle and past health problems. You will be asked if you use medications for blood pressure, cholesterol or heartburn. In many cases, he or she will perform a physical examination including palpating your abdomen and flank area. Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan or intravenous pyelogram (IVP) imaging tests may be performed to confirm the diagnosis. It is important to get treatment right away because complications can arise from untreated kidn ey ston es. Treatment involves drinking plenty of water and taking pain medication.

      "\n",
      "Jell-O  is a brand name that was created in 1897 by carpenter Pearle Bixby Wait to sell his patented gelatin desserts. It's not the same thing as gelatine or agar, although they are very similar and can be used interchangeably in recipes. Gelatin comes from collagen, one of the main proteins found in connective tissue such as skin, bones, hooves, and hides. The word \"gelatin\" itself is derived from the Latin word for animal glue. Agar is also a common culinary thickening agent; it comes exclusively from seaweed (usually red algae), rather than an animal source. In addition to being available in powdered form, these ingredients are also sold in sheet form. Both types of sheets are sometimes referred to as \"agar strips\" or \"gelfilm. \" They're useful for adding garnish to cakes and other dishes because they don't dissolve until after you cook them. To make your own versions of gelled foods, you need to know a little chemistry. Jellied food relies on hydrocolloids, which include substances like pectin, xanthan gum, cornstarch, arrowroot, starch/flour mixtures, methyl cellulose, guar gums, locust bean guma variety of polysaccharides (or long chains of sugar molecules). These compounds are soluble in water but not fat, so they have the ability to turn liquids into jelly-like consistencies. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, including taste, texture, cost, temperature range, ease of use, storage properties, shelf life, etc. For example, using too much flour will give your food a grainy texture. If you want to try experimenting with some of these options, there are dozens of online tutorials and videos that demonstrate how to achieve different textures and effects. While most people think of sweets when they hear the words \"jelly,\" \"jellied,\" or even \"aspics,\" those terms can actually refer to savory food items as well. You may have heard of aspic before, especially if you'\n"

      "\n",
      "Bacterial and viral infections have similar symptoms like fever, sore throat, cough, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, and aches. However, these two types of infection differ in the following aspects:\n",
      "1: Duration of Infection Bacterias take longer to replicate than a virus. You can get rid of a bacteraemia through antibiotics in 3-5 days. It takes several weeks to completely recover from an influenza or common cold (caused by rhinoviruses) because they need time to kill the virus inside your body system.\n",
      "2: Mode of Transmission There are three ways you can be infected with a disease-causing agent: airborne, food/water, or direct contact. Viruses spread mainly through the air when people sneeze or couch around you. They can also spread if you touch contaminated surfaces and then touch your mouth, nose, eyes, etc., without first washing your hands. This mode of transmission is called fecal-oral route. On the other hand, some diseases caused by baceteria do not spread through droplet inhalation but rather on poorly cooked food that has been stored improperly. These include Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium botulinum, and Salmonella typhi.\n",
      "3: Resistance to Chemicals Antibiotic medications will not work against virals. Some chemicals such as chlorine bleach, hydrogen peroxide, ethanol, acetone, phenolic compounds, formaldehyde, iodine, mercury salts, nitric acid, silver nitrate, ammonia, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), alcohol, trisodium phosphate, laundry detergents, ozone, carbolic soap, lye, boiling water, ultraviolet radiation, heat, disinfectants, solvents, heavy metals, oxidizing agents, extreme pH, high salt concentrations, freezing, lysozyme, interferon, osmotic pressure, proteolytic\n"

      "*: The Sun lights up the surface of the Moon (the \"dayside\") so that we can see it in our nighttime sky. *: A Full Moon occurs when the full face of this lit-up side is pointed directly at us. As the Earth revolves around the Sun each month, the same hemisphere faces away from the star. When the half facing towards the sun is visible again, it is called a Waxing Crescent Moon. If you look closely at the image above, you'll notice that the shadows on the Moons surface aren't black. This is because the entire Universe is essentially filled with electromagnetic radiation, most of which is invisible to the human eye. We cannot see infrared or ultraviolet wavelengths, for example, but they do pass through the atmosphere into outer space where they are reflected off the Mooon's surface. Even though the lunar body is about 384,00 kilometers away, some of these photons still make it back to Earth without hitting any other objects along the way. Scientists call this phenomenon diffuse skylight. For more information on why we only see one side of an orbiting object, check out our article on Tidal Locking.\n"
